# Start Upper Layer System

## Introduction

The upper-layer system of dayu, constructed based on the lower-layer system, is the core functional part of the entire system, which can be easily started and stopped as needed in a lightweight manner.

For the specific functions and structure of the upper-layer system, please refer to [architecture](/docs/architecture).

## Start Process

Please start in the following order:

- [Customize template files](/docs/getting-started/start-upper-layer-system/customize-template-files)
- [Deploy mounted files](/docs/getting-started/start-upper-layer-system/deploy-mounted-files)
- [Run Dayu system](/docs/getting-started/start-upper-layer-system/run-dayu-system)


## Tips

- Please ensure that the lower-layer system has been correctly installed and is running normally before starting the upper-layer system. For installation instructions of the lower-layer system, please refer to [Install Lower Layer System](/docs/getting-started/install-lower-layer-system).
