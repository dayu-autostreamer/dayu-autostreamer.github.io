# Getting Started

The [architecture](/docs/architecture) of our Dayu system includes lower/upper layers, follow the steps below to get started:

- Install lower layer system on the cloud-edge devices, which only need to be done once ([instruction](/docs/getting-started/install-lower-layer-system)).

- Run upper layer system based on the lower layer system, which can be started and stopped as needed in a lightweight way ([instruction](/docs/getting-started/start-upper-layer-system)).
