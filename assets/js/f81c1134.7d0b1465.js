[(link)](https://github.com/dayu-autostreamer/dayu/tree/v1.1/template/scheduler/model-switch.yaml)\\n- Add our latest work on video encoding: CRAVE (Collaborative Region-aware Adaptive Video Encoding). It is a region-adaptive video encoding algorithm for cloud-edge collaborative object detection. [(link)](https://github.com/dayu-autostreamer/dayu/tree/v1.1/template/scheduler/crave.yaml)\\n\\n### Bug Fix\\n- Fix problem of write queue full in rtsp datasource server (`datasource`).\\n- Fix possible task loss in the system (`controller` / `distributor`).\\n- Add optional cloud/edge parameters filling in template files for flexible parameter specification in cloud-edge pods.\\n\\n### Minor Update\\n- Add cloud and edge template supplementary to support heterogeneous parameters (`backend`).\\n- Beatify frontend pages (`frontend`).\\n- Refactor template directory to simplify file structure.\\n- Unify the base image for system components. \\n- Add application of age classification. (Current available applications: car-detection, face-detection, gender-classification, age-classification)\\n\\n\\nFor more details, please refer to [dayu-v1.1](https://github.com/dayu-autostreamer/dayu/releases/tag/v1.1)."},{"id":"crave","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/crave","editUrl":"https://github.com/dayu-autostreamer/dayu-autostreamer.github.io/tree/main/blog/2025-03-27-crave/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-27-crave/index.md","title":"New Accepted Paper: CRAVE","description":"Our paper \\"Adaptive Region-aware Video Encoding for Real-time Cloud-edge Collaborative Object Detection\\" is Accepted by IEEE ICDCSW 2025!","date":"2025-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Xie","title":"Dayu Project Chair","url":"https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lxie","imageURL":"https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lxie/Lei%20Xie_files/Xie11.JPG","key":"lxie","page":null},{"name":"Bingyun Yang","title":"Dayu Project Contributor","url":"https://github.com/AdaYangOlzz","imageURL":"https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lxie/research_group/avatar/yangbingyun.jpg","key":"adayang","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"crave","title":"New Accepted Paper: CRAVE","authors":["lxie","adayang"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Dayu v1.1 Released","permalink":"/blog/version1.1"},"nextItem":{"title":"Dayu v1.0 Released","permalink":"/blog/version1.0"}},"content":"Our paper \\"Adaptive Region-aware Video Encoding for Real-time Cloud-edge Collaborative Object Detection\\" is Accepted by IEEE ICDCSW 2025!\\n\\nThis paper proposes CRAVE (Collaborative Region-aware Adaptive Video Encoding), which achieves efficient candidate region extraction through lightweight foreground detection and historical inference result analysis.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nFor more information, please refer to:\\n\\n**Bingyun Yang, Jingyi Ning, Wenhui Zhou, Chuyu Wang, Lei Xie, Zhenjie Lin, Liming Wang.
