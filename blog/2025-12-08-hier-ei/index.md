Our paper "Tackling the Imbalance in Video Analytics Pipelines with Hierarchical Embodied Intelligence" is Accepted by IEEE INFOCOM 2026!

This paper proposes Hier-EI (Hierahical Embodied Intelligence), an efficient scheduling framework that integrates a two-phase hierarchical design with embodied intelligence, 
which simultaneously considers spatial and temporal imbalance and enhance long-term QoE performance in cloud-edge collaborative video analytics pipelines.
